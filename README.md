# pkgview

üîç View AUR PKGBUILD files quickly in your terminal.

---

## Why?

The AUR is a user-maintained repository, which sometimes can contain unsafe or malicious software (see [this](https://linuxiac.com/malware-discovered-in-arch-linux-aur-packages) and [this](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-found-in-arch-linux-aur-package-repository)). Even if the software is safe, users have the right to know exactly what they're installing.
This simple tool helps you quickly view PKGBUILD files before installing packages.
